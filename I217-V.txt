Check the adapter state (this is always disabled on boot for me):

    sudo lshw -C network
    

Make the network connection active:

    sudo ifconfig eno1 up


At this point network is unreachable:

    networking service is up and running

    adapter doesn't seem to have any ip or netmask at this point - check this

    nameserver is set to 127.0.0.53

    setting the name server to 8.8.8.8 does nothing

    at this point there is no route for the ethernet connection



Manually set the ipv4 setting for the ethernet adapter

    sudo ifconfig eno1 192.168.0.15 netmask 255.255.255.0


Set the default gateway

    sudo route add default gw 192.168.0.1 eno1


Set the defualt nameserver - this only works as root sometimes, now it pretty much only works when switching the entire terminal to run as root with sudo -i:

    echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf

	This quite often results in permission denied even using root privlidges. You have to switch to the root account to get this to work.

    Switch to root account and run the command again.

        sudo -i



From ubuntu forums (this seems to work just fine):

    You can install a package resolvconf, which will modify the way /etc/resolv.conf is built up at system boot.

    sudo apt install resolvconf

    You can then create or modify a file /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.detail. If you put in this file a line nameserver 8.8.8.8, this line will be added at the end of /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf at boot. /etc/resolv.conf will now be a symbolic link to this file.


I also wrote the script nic_fix.py, which when run with:

    sudo python nic_fix.py

    seems to clear up the problem.
